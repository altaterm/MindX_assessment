# MindX Strategic Navigator Challenge — Implementation Plan

> Purpose: This plan is written for **Cursor AI** to execute step-by-step. It defines scope, assumptions, milestones, file structure, and acceptance criteria for each task.

---

## 0. Global Rules & Assumptions

* All tasks **use the same dataset** without manual alteration.
* Tasks are **implemented independently**, but may reuse computed outputs.
* Clarity, correctness, and explainability are prioritized over complexity.
* All assumptions must be documented in code comments and README.

---

## 2. Task A — Compliance Engine (ML & Math)

### 2.1 Objective

Build a Python-based engine that:

* Predicts CO2 emissions
* Computes GHG intensity
* Benchmarks vessels against a regulatory target
* Classifies vessels as **Surplus** or **Deficit**

---

### 2.2 Step A1 — Dataset Understanding

**Actions:**

* Load dataset
* Inspect schema, units, missing values
* Identify:

  * Target: `CO2 Emission (Kg)`
  * Features: Ship Type, Distance, Fuel Consumption

**Deliverable:**

* Clear assumptions documented in `exploratory.ipynb`

---

### 2.3 Step A2 — ML Model

**Model Choice:**

* Start with Linear Regression
* Encode categorical ship type (OneHotEncoding)

**Pipeline:**

```
Input Features → Encoder → Model → CO2 Prediction
```

**Evaluation:**

* Use train/test split
* Report RMSE or MAE

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Model runs end-to-end
* Performance metric logged
* No hard-coded outputs

---

### 2.4 Step A3 — GHG Intensity Calculation

**Formula (assumption-based):**

```
GHG Intensity = CO2 Emission (Kg) / Distance
```

* Compute per vessel
* Store as numeric column

---

### 2.5 Step A4 — Regulatory Benchmark

**Logic:**

* Compute fleet-wide average GHG intensity
* Set 2026 target:

```
Target Intensity = Average Intensity × 0.95
```

---

### 2.6 Step A5 — Compliance Balance

**Formula:**

```
Compliance Balance (CB) = Target Intensity − Vessel Intensity
```

**Classification:**

* CB > 0 → Surplus
* CB < 0 → Deficit

---

### 2.7 Step A6 — Output Generation

**Output Fields:**

```json
{
  "vessel_id": "",
  "ship_type": "",
  "distance": 0,
  "co2_emission": 0,
  "ghg_intensity": 0,
  "target_intensity": 0,
  "compliance_balance": 0,
  "status": "Surplus | Deficit"
}
```

* Save to `output/compliance_results.json`

---

## 3. Task B — Fleet Arbitrage Dashboard

### 3.1 Objective

Create a responsive web dashboard that:

* Visualizes fleet compliance risk
* Simulates pooling between surplus and deficit vessels

---

### 3.2 Data Source

* Load `compliance_results.json`
* No backend dependency required

---

### 3.3 UI Sections

1. **Fleet Overview**

   * Total vessels
   * Surplus count
   * Deficit count

2. **Liability Map**

   * Table or cards
   * Color-coded risk (green / yellow / red)

---

### 3.4 Pooling Simulator (Core Logic)

**User Flow:**

* Select one Deficit vessel
* Select one Surplus vessel

**Calculation:**

```
Net Balance = CB_surplus + CB_deficit
```

**Outcome Rules:**

* Net ≥ 0 → Compliance offset achieved
* Net < 0 → Remaining deficit displayed

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Deterministic results
* Instant UI feedback

---

## 4. Task C — Technical Memo (Deep Research)

### 4.1 Objective

Produce a **500-word technical memo (PDF)** identifying and explaining one dataset anomaly.

---

### 4.2 Anomaly Detection

**Methods:**

* Fuel consumption per distance
* Z-score or percentile analysis

**Select:**

* One clearly abnormal vessel

---

### 4.3 Physical Reasoning (Required)

Explain anomaly using maritime engineering concepts:

* Hull biofouling
* Adverse weather
* Engine inefficiency
* Stability / resistance issues
* Sensor miscalibration (only if justified)

---

### 4.4 Memo Structure

1. Title
2. Context
3. Observed Anomaly (with numbers)
4. Physical Explanation
5. Compliance Impact
6. Recommendation

---

## 5. README & Delivery

### 5.1 Main README Must Include

* Project overview
* Task summaries
* Assumptions
* ML metrics
* Pooling logic explanation

---

### 5.2 Git Hygiene

* Minimum 10 commits
* Logical commit messages
* No single massive commit

---

## 6. Final Acceptance Checklist

* [ ] Task A runs end-to-end
* [ ] Compliance math correct
* [ ] Dashboard pooling deterministic
* [ ] Memo links data to physics
* [ ] Public GitHub repo
* [ ] 3-minute walkthrough video
