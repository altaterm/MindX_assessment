# Task C: Technical Memo

## Overview

Deep analysis of dataset anomalies with maritime engineering insights.

## Contents

`MindX_Technical_Memo.pdf` - A 500-word technical memo that:

1. **Identifies** a specific dataset anomaly using statistical methods
2. **Explains** the anomaly using maritime engineering principles
3. **Assesses** the compliance impact
4. **Recommends** corrective actions

## Methodology

### Anomaly Detection
- Fuel consumption per distance analysis
- Z-score and percentile-based outlier detection
- Comparative analysis across vessel types

### Physical Reasoning
Possible explanations explored:
- Hull biofouling (increased drag)
- Adverse weather conditions (higher resistance)
- Engine inefficiency (mechanical degradation)
- Hull stability issues
- Sensor miscalibration (if justified by data)

## Structure

1. **Title & Context**
2. **Observed Anomaly** (with specific numbers)
3. **Physical Engineering Explanation**
4. **Compliance Impact Analysis**
5. **Recommendations**

## Key Findings

*Summary will be added after analysis completion*
